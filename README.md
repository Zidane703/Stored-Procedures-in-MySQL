# Stored-Procedures-in-MySQL

In SQL, a stored procedure is a named set of one or more SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit.

Think of it like this:

Imagine a recipe: A stored procedure is like a saved recipe.
Ingredients: The recipe lists the ingredients (tables and columns) you need.
Instructions: The recipe provides a set of steps (SQL statements) to prepare the dish (process the data).
Key Characteristics:

Reusability: Once created, a stored procedure can be executed repeatedly by simply calling its name. This saves time and effort compared to rewriting the same set of SQL statements each time.
Modularity: They break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units.
Improved Performance: The database server can optimize and cache the execution plan for a stored procedure, leading to faster execution times.
Encapsulation: They encapsulate business logic, making it easier to maintain and modify.
Security: You can grant permissions to specific users to execute certain stored procedures, enhancing data security.
